## Overview

The [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) connector for Azure Service Bus allows you to connect to an [Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/) via the Ballerina language. 

The Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics.It provides the capability to send and receive messages from Service Bus queues, topics, and subscriptions. The Azure Service Bus handles messages that include data representing any kind of information, including structured data encoded with the common formats such as the following ones: JSON, XML, Plain Text.

This module also supports asynchronous message listening capabilities from the azure service bus. Service Bus provides a Microsoft supported [native Java API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/servicebus?view=azure-java-stable) (SDK) and this module make use of this [public API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/servicebus/client?view=azure-java-stable&preserve-view=true). As the public API applies [SAS authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas), this module supports SAS authentication as well.

This module supports [Service Bus SDK 3.5.1 version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/servicebus/client?view=azure-java-stable&preserve-view=true). The source code on GitHub is located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/servicebus/microsoft-azure-servicebus). The primary wire protocol for Service Bus is Advanced Messaging Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 1.0, an open ISO/IEC standard.

## Prerequisites

## Quickstart

To use the Azure Service Bus connector in your Ballerina application, update the .bal file as follows:

### Step 1: Import connector
Import the `ballerinax/asb` module into the Ballerina project.
```ballerina
import ballerinax/asb as asb;
```

### Step 2: Create a new connector instance
Create an `asb:AsbConnectionConfiguration` with the connection string obtained and initialize the connector with it.
```ballerina
asb:AsbConnectionConfiguration config = {
    connectionString: <CONNECTION_STRING>
};

asb:AsbClient asbClient = new (config);
```

### Step 3: Invoke connector operation
1. Now you can use the operations available within the connector. Note that they are in the form of remote operations.

    Following is an example on how to send messages to the Azure Service Bus using the connector. You need to create a `queueSender` before sending a message.

    Send a message to the Azure Service Bus

    ```ballerina
    public function main() returns error? {
        asb:MessageSender queueSender = check new(connectionString, queueName);

        string stringContent = "This is My Message Body"; 
        byte[] byteContent = stringContent.toBytes();
        int timeToLive = 60; // In seconds

        asb:ApplicationProperties applicationProperties = {
            properties: {a: "propertyValue1", b: "propertyValue2"}
        };

        asb:Message message = {
            body: byteContent,
            contentType: asb:TEXT,
            timeToLive: timeToLive,
            applicationProperties: applicationProperties
        };

        check asbClient->send(queueSender, message);

        check asbClient->closeSender(queueSender);
    }
    ```

    Following is an example on how to receive messages from the Azure Service Bus using the client connector. You need to create a 
    `queueReceiver` before receiving a message. Optionally you can provide the receive mode which is PEEKLOCK by default. You can find more information about the receive modes [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.receivemode?view=azure-java-stable).

    Receive a message from the Azure Service Bus

    ```ballerina
        public function main() returns error? {
            asb:MessageReceiver queueReceiver = check new(connectionString, queueName, asb:RECEIVEANDDELETE);

            int serverWaitTime = 60; // In seconds

            asb:Message|asb:Error? messageReceived = queueReceiver->receive(serverWaitTime);

            if (messageReceived is asb:Message) {
                log:printInfo("Reading Received Message : " + messageReceived.toString());
            } else if (messageReceived is ()) {
                log:printError("No message in the queue.");
            } else {
                log:printError("Receiving message via Asb receiver connection failed.");
            }

            check asbClient->closeReceiver(queueReceiver);
        }
    ```

    Following is an example on how to asynchronously listen to messages from the Azure Service Bus using the listener. 
    You need to create a new listener instance before listening. Then, you need to create a service object with the service 
    configuration specified using the `@asb:ServiceConfig` annotation and attach it to the listener. You need to give the 
    connection string and the entity path of the queue we are to listen messages from. We can optionally provide the 
    receive mode. Default mode is the PEEKLOCK mode. You can find more information about the receive modes 
    [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.receivemode?view=azure-java-stable). 
    Finally, you can provide the service logic to execute when a message is received inside the onMessage remote function.

    Listen to Messages from the Azure Service Bus

    **!!! NOTE:**
    When configuring the listener, the entity path for a Queue is the entity name (Eg: "myQueueName") and the entity path 
    for a subscription is in the following format `<topicName>/subscriptions/<subscriptionName>` 
    (Eg: "myTopicName/subscriptions/mySubscriptionName").

    ```ballerina
    listener asb:Listener asbListener = new ();

    @asb:ServiceConfig {
        entityConfig: {
            connectionString: <CONNECTION_STRING>,
            entityPath: <ENTITY_PATH>,
            receiveMode: <PEEKLOCK_OR_RECEIVEONDELETE>
        }
    }
    service asb:Service on asbListener {
        remote function onMessage(asb:Message message) returns error? {
            // Write your logic here
            log:printInfo("Azure service bus message as byte[] which is the standard according to the AMQP protocol" + 
            message.toString());
            string|xml|json|byte[] received = message.body;

            match message?.contentType {
                asb:JSON => {
                    string stringMessage = check string:fromBytes(<byte[]> received);
                    json jsonMessage = check value:fromJsonString(stringMessage);
                    log:printInfo("The message received: " + jsonMessage.toJsonString());
                }
                asb:XML => {
                    string stringMessage = check 'string:fromBytes(<byte[]> received);
                    xml xmlMessage = check 'xml:fromString(stringMessage);
                    log:printInfo("The message received: " + xmlMessage.toString());
                }
                asb:TEXT => {
                    string stringMessage = check 'string:fromBytes(<byte[]> received);
                    log:printInfo("The message received: " + stringMessage);
                }
            }
        }
    };
    ```

    **!!! NOTE:**
    Currently we are using the asb:Message record for both sender & receiver operations. When we use the ASB receiver connector instead of the ASB listener to receive messages we return the exact message converted (re-engineered) to the specific data type based on the content type of the message. But in the ASB listener we receive the message body as byte[] which is the standard according to the AMQP protocol. We haven't re-engineered the listener. Rather we provide the message body as a standard byte[]. So the user must do the conversion based on the content type of the message. We have provided a sample code segment above, where you can do the conversion easily.


2. Use `bal run` command to compile and run the Ballerina program.
